# R_computerVision
This a repository of some computer vision related R programs using Rvision and openCV.

If your R version starts with 4.0 or 4.1, you will need to install Rtools40.
If your R version starts with 4.2, you will need to install Rtools42.
If your R version starts with 4.3 or 4.4 (devel), you will need to install Rtools43

Installing Cmake is only required if your R version starts with 4.0 or 4.1 and, 
therefore, you have installed Rtools40. For newer versions of R, Cmake is included in Rtools42 and Rtools43
